Hello!

Welcome to The 3-Point Challenge Game!

This game is a simple web-based game where you aim the ball at the backboard and you get one point for every time the ball hits the backboard.

Directions:
1 - Use 'UP' and 'DOWN' arrows to aim the ball at the basketball hoop.

2 - Once you feel that the ball is correctly aimed at the backboard, press the  'SPACE BAR' to shoot the ball. If the ball successfully hits the backboard, you will receive a point on your scoreboard.

3 - Once the ball has stopped moving, press the 'R' key to reset the ball in the player's hands so you can shoot again.

4 - Once you score 10 points, then game will end. You must press CRTL + R to restart the game.
